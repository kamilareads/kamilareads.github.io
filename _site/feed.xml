        <title>Łzy Mai by Martyna Raduchowska</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Łzy Mai by Martyna Raduchowska is a story based in cyberpunk reality. The action is taking place in the city of New Horizon, full of life and advanced technologies. We meet machines which took on all the easy, manual tasks done earlier by people. We also have androids, robots which look almost exactly the same as humans, while the latest ones fully embraced the bliss of advanced technology by using brain implants, cybernetic limbs or other upgrades. Sounds good? Yes, but all it’s not as wonderful as it may seems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From the very first pages of the book we are...</description>

        <title>Obsidio by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Obsidio by Amie Kaufman and Jeff Kristoff is the final book of the Illuminae Files trilogy. After first two books I was completely swept away and couldn’t believe how good they were. So the bar was set very high for it to deliver an equal satisfying ending to this epic space journey. Has it succeeded?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This part of the story is slightly different. We are again introduced with two more main characters (and lots of secondary ones) while the story is coming to an inevitable end. Because of that I feel like Asha and Rhys are my least favourite characters,...</description>

        <title>Caraval by Stephanie Garber</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Caraval by Stephanie Garber is a book about two sisters who wanted to escape from their cruel father and to do that they throw themselves into mysterious and dangerous game of Caraval. They’ve heard the tales and legends about it and always dreamt of seeing it by their own eyes. And also, this year prize is one wish for the winner. What could go wrong?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve heard a lot of good and bad opinions about this book. So of course I had to see by myself what all the discussion is about! I’m not regretting it. It reminds me a...</description>

        <title>A Court of Frost and Starlight by S. J. Maas</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A Court of Frost and Starlight is a short novella happening after ACOWAR. There is a lot of mixed feelings about this book. Some fans love it, as all S. J. Maas books, where others felt utterly disappointed with it. So let me say it: it is not a full part of the series as previous book. It’s more of few extra days with characters, kind of a gift for fans to not miss them too much while waiting for the next book. So I took this book with not too high expectations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We meet our beloved characters a few...</description>

        <title>More Then a Game by Andrey Vasilyev</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;More Then a Game by Andrey Vasilyev is the first book in Fayroll series. It’s the literary genre called LitRPG short for Literary Role Playing Game which is basically combination of online gaming and fantasy/sci-fi fiction. It was my first opportunity to discover this genre (not counting Ready Player One) and a very pleasant one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main character Harriton Nikiforov is a journalist who has got a story to write about new, amazingly popular Virtual Gaming World of Fayroll. And it’s not just a normal computer game. He’d got some high tech equipment which enables him to immerse completely to...</description>

        <title>The Long War by Sir T. Pratchett and S. Baxter</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Long War is the second book in the series written by sir Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter. The story is based quite a few years after the first tome. Joshua is now a middle aged man and has his own family - wife and a son. Stepping is a new way of life and people are busy with colonizing countless of Long Earths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It starts with a big stomp, the scene where we can see cruelty of humans experimenting on defenceless, kind-hearted trolls. And after that and the title I was expecting some great plot and terrible conflict tearing...</description>

This time action moves from fleeing fleet to jump station Heimdall, where our main characters are Hanna Donnelly and Niklas Malikov.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the beginning the book starts a little bit slow. We learn about the everyday life in the space station at the edge of the galaxy. We get to now Hanna, the daughter of the station commander with her rich girl problems and love life. We meet Niklas, her drug dealer, and small time criminal who fell in love with her completely...</description>
