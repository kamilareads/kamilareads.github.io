        <title>Gdzie śpiewają diabły</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Azyl. It seems as world have forgotten about this little town. Phones are not working here, not to mention the Internet. There’s a lot of big, empty houses and their numbers are against any logic or order. But the names of the streets are really poetic. There is also a lake here, the town’s folk calls it Devil’s Lake, although you won’t find it on any map. Its surface is jet black and its coast very treacherous, so don’t let its beauty deceive you. Sometimes you can hear the Devil singing here. Local people can tell you the...</description>

        <title>Legion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Legion: The Many Lives of Stephen Leeds by Brandon Sanderson is an anthology of three short novellas about a genius Stephen Leeds. To deal with his extraordinary mind he is creating a hallucinations, aspects as he calls them, of the experts in differences fields who help him deal with all kind of situations. He works as a detective and only takes the cases that interests him, which also are not ordinary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed this book, although it won’t be my favourite from this author. I do prefer the complex stories full of details and many different story threads. But...</description>

        <title>It Ends with Us</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was never big fan of contemporary books. They were never high on my reading list. But this year I decided to challenge myself to read more diverse books then my usual fantasy/sci-fi choices. I’ve heard many times that if I want to read good contemporary book I should try Colleen Hoover books. So when I’ve got a chance to read It Ends with Us I took it. And I was very surprised that it was a really good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We meet Lily Bloom after her father funeral, where she refused to say anything good about him. He used to beat...</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Amber Reynolds woke up in a hospital, but she can’t open her eyes, can’t move the finger and can’t open her mouth. She remember having a car accident but all the details are a blur. She’s aware of her surrounding and can hear everything people are saying. She’s trying to put her memories back in order, piece by piece, to remember what had happened during last few days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We discover Amber’s story in three ways. Chapters interlace from now with a few days before the accident and the dairy entries, from when protagonist was ten years old. It quickly turns...</description>

        <title>Pierwsze Słowo</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Pierwsze Słowo by Marta Kisiel is an anthology containing fantasy stories which are funny but sometimes very dark. I haven’t read anything else from this author yet, but since first pages I was very pleasantly surprised. Very short story “Rozmowa dyskwalifikacyjna” made me cry from laughter and the next one “Dożywocie” I was reading long into the night, because I couldn’t put it down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author has very intelligent way of writing, she’s not afraid to laugh at our nowadays life, full of technology and never-ending work for corporations. I really like this kind of humour. Most of the novellas...</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In her debut First Year Rachel E. Carter is taking us to Jerar, a fantasy land, where all young people are faced with a choice. Either pursue career in trade or try to get into most prestigious academy to become a soldier, knight or a mage. Our protagonist, Ryiah, is convinced she is good enough to become a mage, and not just an Alchemist or a Healer. She’s striving to be the most elite kind of them all - a Combat mage.

        <title>Only the Ocean</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve got Only the Ocean by Natasha Carthew form a book box and, considering a beautiful cover, I couldn’t wait to dig right into it. It turned out it wasn’t that easy. The book is written in a very peculiar way. The author is heavy emphasising different accents and way of speaking for the main character, who is a girl from poor ‘swamp folk’. From the very beginning this book is very hard to read. I had to be very focused to understand what exactly was happening, and even though I tried, I often was confused and couldn’t imagine it...</description>

        <title>Heir to the Empire</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Heir to the Empire by Timothy Zahn is the first book of Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy and was published 27 years ago. That’s kind of crazy when you think about it, because it’s as easy to read as it was written recently. I’ve read author’s book for the first time last year and it was recently written Thrawn. I really enjoyed it and I fell in love with it’s main character. My husband suggested that I should read the original trilogy then, which was brilliant in his opinion. So we dug it up from our family house and I...</description>

        <title>Skyward</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Skyward by Brandon Sanderson is an epic sci-fi young adult book, but I can assure you, that everyone can read and enjoy it. I was never let down by this author and this time was the same. I don’t know what exactly makes his writing so great, but every time I take up one of his book I’m swept away with the tale.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This time we learn the story of Spensa, a girl who dreamt about being a starfighter pilot, like her father. She lives on a planet, where her ancestors crashed onto many years ago. Humankind is almost driven...</description>

        <title>Elevation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Elevation by Stephen King is a short story about an ordinary man who experience extraordinary things. It’s hardly a novella, as it has 132 pages with big letters and big margins and also some nice illustrations. Basically you can read it in just one evening. And as it is King we are talking about you won’t be bored with it. Just for the record, this book was voted best Horror book of 2018 by Good Reads users, but don’t let that scare you. It is NOT a horror.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;King’s greatest talent I think, is telling people’s stories and creating worlds...</description>

They got swept from the dark bunker, where they were hiding in London during WWII, to beautiful forest. They are offered a refuge, a place to stay if they help with this new world own problems. Who would refuse, knowing that they can always come back home as no time would pass?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I thought The Light Between Worlds would be retelling of Narnia, as the motive is exactly the same - children...</description>

Of course it’s much darker and more complicated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have two main protagonists here. First is Lira - the daughter of Sea Queen herself, the one who got for herself another name that everyone else fear, Princes’ Bane. The sirens collect human’s hearts to gain more power, and Lira, the most powerful of them all, only hunt for princes.

She just want to get by, staying close to her only friend Mal, who is one of army’s best tracker. Everything changes, when they’re trying to cross the Shadow Fold, unnatural darkness crawling with monsters, which divides Ravka in half. They...</description>

It covers the same time period and events as first book. But this time the story is said from perspective of May the android.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Firstly I wasn’t thrilled with this idea, I wanted to know what happened next? But I actually liked this book more than the first one. I like Maya as protagonist, who despite her good intentions is called a traitor and have to flee to the Wall to save her life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the...</description>

        <title>The Cruel Prince by Holly Black</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Cruel Prince by Holly Black is a story about a girl who is forced to live among faeries in their magical kingdom. Sounds a bit familiar? Yes, I was sceptical and I wasn’t sure if I want to read it. I thought it was another version of ACOTAR and title indicating a romance theme. I couldn’t have been more wrong! I’m so glad I decided to read this book, because it is so much more!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our main character is Jude, whose parents were murdered when she was a kid and she and her sisters are taken in by Fae...</description>

        <title>Metro 2034 by Dmitry Glukhovsky</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Metro 2034 written by Dmitry Glukhovsky is a post-apocalyptic tale about the people who survived the atomic war and now live trapped in Moscow subway system. The surface of the planet is polluted and now all kind of strange monsters are ruling there. It’s a sequel to a very popular Metro 2033, second book in a trilogy. I loved the first book, it was innovative and original, I was captivated by Artem’s story. Unfortunately the second book failed to impress me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story itself is less interesting then in a first book. Unexpectedly all contact is broken with the neighboured...</description>

        <title>The Lost Witch by Melvin Burgess</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Lost Witch written by Melvin Burgess is a story about witches set in the modern world. I was very excited for this book, because I find witches fascinating and was very curious what kind of tale the author will tell us. But I find this book very confusing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Firstly, the cover, which is very beautiful, is very misleading (although this is publisher fault, the author said he didn’t like it either). It shows a young woman, when in fact the main character, Bea, is just thirteen years old when the book starts. It was very difficult for me to...</description>

        <title>The Assassin's Blade by Sarah J. Maas</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Assassin’s Blade by Sarah J. Maas is a book that contains five novellas about events that happened before the Throne of Glass series. I decided to read it first, because I like to read the story in chronological order.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have to say it is a really good books. The fact that it is composed from a short novellas didn’t disturb receiving book as a whole story. We have a clear action flow from one tale to another. They were all action packed and interesting, so they got me really hooked. I wished I had time just to sit...</description>

        <title>The Renegades by Marissa Meyer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Renegades by Marissa Meyer is a story about people with extraordinary powers - heroes and villains. It sounded like my kind of book. I love all the comics and movies from Marvel and DC about superheroes! And I was curious about this author, as I haven’t read the Lunar Chronicles for which she is praised so much. So when a friend suggested me to read it I was on it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then the reality came. This is a really big book. Hardback has about 550 pages (and I got myself a hardback because paperback was just plain ugly!). But...</description>

        <title>Łzy Mai by Martyna Raduchowska</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Łzy Mai by Martyna Raduchowska is a story based in cyberpunk reality. The action is taking place in the city of New Horizon, full of life and advanced technologies. We meet machines which took on all the easy, manual tasks done earlier by people. We also have androids, robots which look almost exactly the same as humans, while the latest ones fully embraced the bliss of advanced technology by using brain implants, cybernetic limbs or other upgrades. Sounds good? Yes, but all it’s not as wonderful as it may seems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From the very first pages of the book we are...</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Obsidio by Amie Kaufman and Jeff Kristoff is the final book of the Illuminae Files trilogy. After first two books I was completely swept away and couldn’t believe how good they were. So the bar was set very high for it to deliver an equal satisfying ending to this epic space journey. Has it succeeded?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This part of the story is slightly different. We are again introduced with two more main characters (and lots of secondary ones) while the story is coming to an inevitable end. Because of that I feel like Asha and Rhys are my least favourite characters,...</description>

They’ve heard the tales and legends about it and always dreamt of seeing it by their own eyes. And also, this year prize is one wish for the winner. What could go wrong?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve heard a lot of good and bad opinions about this book. So of course I had to see by myself what all the discussion is about! I’m not regretting it. It reminds me a...</description>

        <title>A Court of Frost and Starlight by S. J. Maas</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A Court of Frost and Starlight is a short novella happening after ACOWAR. There is a lot of mixed feelings about this book. Some fans love it, as all S. J. Maas books, where others felt utterly disappointed with it. So let me say it: it is not a full part of the series as previous book. It’s more of few extra days with characters, kind of a gift for fans to not miss them too much while waiting for the next book. So I took this book with not too high expectations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We meet our beloved characters a few...</description>
