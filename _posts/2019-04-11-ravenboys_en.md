  The Raven Boys written by Maggie Stiefvater is a first book in very popular series called The Raven Cycle. I was seeing references from those books everywhere and I also got couple of merch from my monthly bookish boxes so I finally decided that it's high time for me to check out this story, and here we are.

  Blue is not a typical teenager. Her mother is a fortune-teller. And all her aunts and other family members too. She seems to be the only person without an ability to see the future in some way. But she also has her own special skills. She can enhance other people's paranormal abilities. Blue is used to being used as an assistant by her mother and aunts, but everything changes, when one night she unexpectedly sees a ghost of a boy. And that means he'll be dead before a year pass. It would be traumatic enough even if she haven't met him few days afterwards.

  Gansey is a rich privileged boy who has one obsession, finding lost Raven King - Glendower. He uses all his vast resources in his search. That's why he chose Henrietta as a place where he's attending school, one of the best in country, yes, but it doesn't really matter to him. Because in here, every paranormal thing seems to be more intense, so he's sure that he'll find the lost king soon, with help of his friends.

  When I started reading this book I wasn't sure if I was going to like it. The story didn't seem to be very original. A lone, weird girl meets some privileged, rich boys and then unlikely friendship/love is forged. But then, when I read on I found out, that I really like the Raven Boys. Blue is not that interesting, but the boys are. Each of them is different and has interesting backstory and his own problems. Even Gansey, who poses as very rational, self-confident and always in control kind of person, can be unsure and helpless, when it comes to contacts with people who he truly cares about.

  The book is really quick read. There's not much excessive descriptions and there's a lot of funny dialogues. The search, which is a main plot of the book, gets more interesting and dangerous with every turned page. And some weird things are happening too. I finally understand a quote from this book: the trees speak Latin. I got it on some of my merch and I never new what that was about. There was also one twist I didn't see coming, but when it does, it makes so much sense. I really like that one, but I can't write anything else and not spoil your fun.

  If you search for some light YA with paranormal elements it would be a great pick. The author has real talent to create likable characters, funny conversation and really magical sceneries, where everything is possible. I'm sure I'll continue reading about Raven Boys and their adventures.
