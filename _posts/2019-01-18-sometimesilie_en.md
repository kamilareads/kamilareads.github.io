  Amber Reynolds woke up in a hospital, but she can't open her eyes, can't move the finger and can't open her mouth. She remember having a car accident but all the details are a blur. She's aware of her surrounding and can hear everything people are saying. She's trying to put her memories back in order, piece by piece, to remember what had happened during last few days.

  We discover Amber's story in three ways. Chapters interlace from now with a few days before the accident and the dairy entries, from when protagonist was ten years old. It quickly turns out that what happened was not a simple accident, Amber has a signs of violence all over her body, but they are from before the accident.

  The book is a psychological thriller, we can sense the tension from the first pages. Main character feels she is in a mortal danger, but is not sure why and who is threatening her. Amber is a vary troubled person. She has obsessive compulsive disorder, she hates her body and feel utterly unhappy and unseen. She also has a strong feeling that her husband is cheating on her. With her sister probably.

  The chapters with the dairy were really sad. It showed a very dysfunctional family and a neglected child, who was very often just left alone, because it could manage well enough. But what first was total disapproval for the parents started to turn into surprise, when poor child showed more and more sociopathic behaviours. Then again, it was very eyes opening to read how parents can neglect their child and not even know it. And how can it affect a person for the rest of her life.

  The story itself is very interesting and engaging. When I read the words 'Sometimes I lie' I knew some nice plot twists were coming. After first two I was surprised and intrigued. But then more twists kept coming and it was like they were waiting in every corner of the story. For me it was a bit too much to be honest. Sometimes less means more and I would prefer to have just a few of them but very carefully justified and executed. Here at some point of the book I was like: oh yeah, whatever, it will probably all change in the next few pages. Some of the author explanations seemed too improbable to me and didn't fit well enough to the story.

  This book reminds me of 'Gone girl' by Gillian Flynn a little, there is very similar atmosphere in both of these stories. Although I liked 'Gone girl' better, as I think the history there were more probable and appealing. But if you like this kind of books I'm sure you'll enjoy this one too. Just be ready for a lot of twist and turns on the way!
