  Would you like to have a photographic memory? All your brain would need is just one look to remember all the information from the viewed page. Or maybe you would like to go further, to remember everything, every little detail of your life, each conversation, every argument and all the sad things that ever happened to you? It doesn’t sound so appealing anymore, does it? But Jess Wilson must deal with it since she turned 11. How can you live your life, when your friend jumped from the window, and every time you close your eyes you can see her bloody, broken body? 

  The Truth About Lies by Tracy Darnton is a good young adult mystery novel. We meet Jess, who is gifted with super memory and her struggles to be a normal girl. Unfortunately, the past has a tendency to catch up with us in the least expected moments. Is Jess ready to uncover the dark truth about her past? And can she trust those who call themselves her friends?

  The book is very easy to read, and it’s a good summer read. You can’t get bored with it, because it’s full of action. The main character is very likeable, firstly she is a bit withdrawn and shy, but later she will surprise you with her outbursts of courage and claws. I also liked the side characters. I must admit, there wasn’t anyone uncomplicated and straightforward. Starting with school psychologist with middle-age crisis and alcohol problem and finishing on the typical Barbie, daughter of wealthy Russian parents who only want to party, but then turns out she’s very rational and down to earth person.

  We also have some plot twists her. They’re not very surprising, but they make the whole story more dynamic. We want to finish the novel to uncover what really happened in Jess’s past.

  I recommend this book not only for young adults. Don’t be afraid to read books from this genre, because you can find some real treasures, which will provide you with captivating story and make your afternoon brighter. Especially if you are looking for some light tales for summertime.
