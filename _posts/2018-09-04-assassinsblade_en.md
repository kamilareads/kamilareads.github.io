The Assassin's Blade by Sarah J. Maas is a book that contains five novellas about events that happened before the Throne of Glass series. I decided to read it first, because I like to read the story in chronological order.

I have to say it is a really good books. The fact that it is composed from a short novellas didn't disturb receiving book as a whole story. We have a clear action flow from one tale to another. They were all action packed and interesting, so they got me really hooked. I wished I had time just to sit and read it all at once.

Our main character is Celaena Sardothien, the most notorious assassin in whole Adarlan and a protegee of Arobynn Hamel himself (head of Assassin's Guild). And she just happens to be sixteen years old when we meet her. She's very good in her job but also very proud. But the hard life haven't yet killed her idealism. She had strong moral believes and act on them, even knowing it will cost her a great deal.

I really enjoy her journey through the all novellas. She got more humble and less selfish, but as confident as ever. You really feel for all her losses and heartbreaks. The author has a really clever way of writing plot twists. She give away hints for the reader that something is amiss and we can only read on helplessly, watching Celaena going head into danger.

I wasn't really surprised with all those twist. Even though I keep myself from reading about the Throne of Glass series and what it's about, I had a feeling that things won't end up very good for our heroine. And I really feel for her and everything she had lost.

Another small thing I really like was that Celaena has such a love for books and music. It was so good to get to know her, not only the merciless assassin, but also a young girl who is in awe at everything that is beautiful in this world.

I was very positively surprised by this book - it's just my kind of story. I think it is very good beginning for the series. I'm now a little bit afraid to start reading the Throne of Glass, as I've heard that first two books are not that great. But I'll read them anyway, because those five novellas had really picked my interest and I want to see what will happen to Celaena next!
