  “Aurora Burning” by amazing authors duo Jay Kristoff and Amy Kaufman was a book I was waiting for since I finished “Aurora Rising”. I preordered it as soon as it was available and couldn’t wait to have it in my hands finally. Nothing would make me happier than meeting sassy squad 312 and join their adventures once again.

  From the very beginning, the action does not slow down. Facing the looming threat of ancient evil alien race that infiltrated human’s intelligence agency already and are going to devour the whole galaxy is not an easy task. We should also add that Aurora is the only one who can stop them, but she can’t even control the powers that dwell inside of her. Also, as if this wasn’t enough, a new threat approach – a Syldrathi hunter, determined to drag Kal back to join his people.

  Squad 312 is all alone against the whole angry universe, and also, they are one member down, and there is also a bounty for their heads. But there is nothing that can stop them, once they set their goal. In the second book, we learn a bit more about all characters. We discover more of their backstories and events that determined why they became who they are and how did they end up in this whole mess in the first place. But it turns out there is no such thing as coincidence. I enjoyed that thread. Discovering small clues here and there that determined some force has made it all happen. It is not explained here yet, so we’ll have to wait for the next book to find out what is it exactly. 

  The whole book and its characters are a bit peculiar. I think not all readers might like it, but after “Aurora Burning” you should find out if you are ok with authors style or not. All protagonists are obviously beyond amazing; they are beautiful/handsome, have mad skills and are incredibly sassy. Sometimes the conversations are even too cheesy for me. But then, I can’t say it’s not fun to read, most of the time I had a huge grin on my face while reading this book. There are also sombre moments that took you by surprise by how deep and meaningful they are. I think that’s what mesmerized me the most in “The Aurora Cycle”.

  Plot-wise, there are quite a few revelations and some plot twists along the way. I wasn’t surprised, to be honest, but I like where all events are heading. Book is ending in the middle of the action sequence, which is a bit disappointing, considering we will need to wait at least another year to know what happens next. The whole series is said to have at least four or five volumes, so there is still a lot to looking forward to.

  I’m a fan of the authors' duo and enjoyed this book immensely, besides a few minor things that annoyed me a bit. It is still a great and entertaining read, full of action and sci-fi blasts. I’m sure all fans of “Illuminae Files” series will love it unconditionally.
